## Changelog

**Add test harness**: Feb 2-3

 - `./simple --only-scanner` outputs a space-separated list of tokens
 - `make test` compares generated tokens with expected tokens
 - `make test` ensures parser accepts valid programs (there's no output)
 - `make test` ensures parser rejects invalid programs (there *is* output)
 - Added tests for each new feature introduced

**Implement scanner**: Feb 3

 - The rule for octal numbers is above the rule for decimal numbers
 - Tokens that are not single-character operators get a `%token` declaration in
   parser.ypp
 - Used a [start condition][] to implement multi-line, non-greedy comments

  [start condition]: http://flex.sourceforge.net/manual/Start-Conditions.html

**Implement parser**: Feb 3

 - Used left-recursion [for efficiency][recursion]
 - Use `%left`, `%right`, and `%nonassoc` to disambiguate the grammar according
   to [this C/C++ precedence table][precedence]

  [recursion]: http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/html_node/Recursion.html
  [precedence]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedence

**Implement AST generator**: Feb 17

 - Add harness files from class website
 - Add actions to parser rules to construct the AST
 - Separate `Assignment` parser rule into `Assignment` and `ArrayAssignment`;
   likewise with `FunctionCall`
 - Add `Identifier` and `Number` parser rules that have an action that creates
   a `Primitive()` instead of adding the code to create a `Primitive()` every
   time `IDENTIFIER` and `NUMBER` are used.
 - Set `yylval` in lexer rules to propagate integer values and symbol names
 - Check that [each test][] passes (done manually: test harness not updated)
